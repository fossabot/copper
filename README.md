## A low-ish rust minecraft launcher

This is meant to be a low-level structural launcher where everything is done separately.
You don't launch and let it download the assets. You first download the assets and then launch.

**MICROSOFT ONLY** becauce mojang is being removed in the future. Migrate now

## Testing

Testing basically works by:

- Run single test
- See if output makes sense

What makes sense should make sense for the launcher
