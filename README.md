## A plug-and-play rust minecraft launcher

This is meant to be a structural launcher where all you need is a struct, some input, and directories.
You don't build the launcher, download assets from the built, launcher, and then some other stuff.
All you do is create an asset folder, get the version manifest and start a download.
